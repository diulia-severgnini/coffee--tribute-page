  <p id="paragraphs">One of the most popular drinks in the world, coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans and presented in a variety of ways.</br> It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.</br> Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavour.</br> Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</br> Coffee is darkly coloured, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</li>
  <li>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines. By the 16th century, the drink had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.</li>
  <li>Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa.</li> 
  <li>The two most commonly grown species are C. arabica and C. robusta.</li>
  <li>Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.</li>
  <li>As of 2016, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing one-third of the world total.</li>
</ul>

<p id="paragraphs">Some controversy has been associated with coffee cultivation and the way developed countries trade with developing nations, as well as the impact on the environment with regards to the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.</br>Consequently, the markets for fair trade and organic coffee are expanding.</p>
